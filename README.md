### My Plan
The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the 
selfish and the tyranny of evil men. 
Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak 
through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the 
finder of lost children.
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those 
who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name 
is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.
